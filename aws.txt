    LEARNING AWS
Iam : Permissions : 

- Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- These policlies define the permissions of the users 
- In AWS you apply the least privilege principle  : don’t give more
Permissions than a user needs

IAM Policies Structure
Consists of 
-	Version : policy language version 
-	Id : an identifier for the policy
-	Statement : one or more individual statements (required)
Statements consists of 
-	Sid : an identifier for the statement (optional)
-	Effect : whether the statement allows or denies access ( Allow , Deny)
-	Principal : account/user/role to which this policy applied to
-	Action : list of actions this policy allows or denies
-	Resource :list of resources to which the actions applied to
-	Condition : conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

IAM – PASSWORD POLICY
2 Defense mechanisms : 
-	Strong passwords = higher security for your account 
-	In AWS , you can setup a password policy

o	Set a minium password length
o	Require specific character types
	Including uppercase letters 
	Lowercase letters
	Number , or non alphanumeric character (ki tu dac biet )
o	Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
o	Require user to change their password after some time (password exp)
o	Prevent password re-use
Multi Factor Authen – MFA
-	Users have acess to your account and can possibly change config or delete
Resources in your AWS account 
-	You want to protect your Root Accounts and IAM users
-	MFA = password you know + security device you own

Section 8
•	Application load balancer (v2)
•	Application load balancers is Layer 7 (HTTP)
•	Load balancing to multiple HTTP app (target groups)
•	Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine 
•	Support for http/2 and websocket
•	Support redirects (http/https)
•	Routing tables to different target groups:
o	Routing path url
o	Routing hostname url
o	Routing on query string, header 
•	ALB are a great fit for micro and container app
•	Has a port mapping feature to redirect to dynamic port in ecs
•	In comparsion , we’d need multiple classic load balancer per application 
 
Application load balancer (v2) target group

•	EC2 instances (can be managed by an auto scaling group) – HTTP
•	ECS task (managed by ecs it self) -HTTP
•	Lambda function – HTTP req/ JSON event
•	Private IP address
•	ALB can route to multiple target group
•	Health checks are at the target group level

ALB (v2) Good to know
•	Fixed hostname 
•	the application servers don’t see the IP client 
	inserted in the header X-forwarded-for
Network Load Balancer (ELB v2)
•	Network load balancers (Layer 4 ) allow to
o	Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
o	Handle millions of request per seconds 
o	Less latency ~100ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
•	NLB as one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP
•	NLB as used for extreme performance , TCP or UDP traffic
•	Not free 

Gateway Load Balancer
•	Deploy scale , and manage a fleet of 3rd party network
•	Operates Layer 3 ( network layer ) – IP packets 
•	Combines the following function : 
o	Transparent network gateway
o	Load balancer
•	Uses the GENEVE port 6081
•	Ec2 instance
•	Private IP address
Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)
•	This works for Classic Load balancers & application Load balancer
•	The “cookie” used for stickiness has an exp date
•	Enabling stickness may bring imbalance to the load over the be EC2
Sticky Sessions – Cookie Names 
•	Application-based Cookie
o	Custom cookie
	Don’t use AWSALB , AWSALPAPP , AWSALBTG
o	Application cookie
	As AWSALBAPP
•	Duration-based cookie
o	Cookie generated by the load balancer
o	Cookie name is AWSALB for alb , AWSELB

Cross-Zone Load balancing
•	Application Load Balancer
o	Always on 
o	No changes for inter AZ
•	Network Load Balancer
o	Default as disabled
o	Pay charges 
•	Classic Load Balancer
o	Disabled by default
o	No charges for inter AZ





Section 9 : 
SSL - Basics 
-   An ssl Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer
to be encrypted in transit 
-   SSL refer to Secure Sockets Layer , used to Encrypt connections 
-   TLS refers to transport Layer security , which is a newer version
-   Nowadays , TLS cert are mainly used , but SSL refer
-   Public ssl cert ase issues by (CA)
-   SSL cert have an exp ( you set ) and must be renewed
Load Balancer - SSL Cert 
-   The load Balancer uses an X509 cert (SSL/TLS)
-   You can manage cert usign ACM
-   You can create upload your own cert alternatively
    HTTPS Listener : 
    +   You must specify a default cert
    +   add an option of cert when support multi domain
    +   Clients can use SNI(Server Name indi) to specify hostname
    +   ability to specify a security policy to support SSL/TLS

SSL -  Server Name Indication
-   SNI solves the problem of loading multi SSL cert onto one web Server
-   It's a "newer" protocol, and requies the client to indicate the hostname
    of the target server in the initial SSL 
-   The server will then find the correct cert , of return the default one
    Note : 
        +   Only work for ALB-NLB
        +   Does not work for CLB
ELB - SSL cert
-   Classic Load Balancer (v1)
    +   support only one SSL cert
    +   Must use multi CLB for multi host with multi cert
-   Application Load Balancer (v2)
    +   Support multi Listener with multi SSL cert
    +   Uses SNI to make it work
-   Network Load Balancer (v2)
    +   Support multi Listener with multi cert 
    +   Users SNI

Connection Draining
-   Feature naming
    +   Connection Draining : CLB
    +   Deregistration : ALB - NLB
-   Time to complete "in flight request " while the instance is 
    de-registering or unhealthy
-   Stops sending new request to ec2 instance which ism  de-registering
-   Between 1 to 3600 sec (default as 300 , 0 as disabled)
-   Set to a low value if your request are short 
Auto scalling Group? 
-   The goal of Auto Scalling Group(ASG) is to :
    +   Scale out (add EC2 instance) to match an increased Load
    +   Scale in (remove EC2 instance) to match a decrease load 
    +   Ensure we have a minium and a maximum number of ec2 instances running
    +   Auto matically register new instances to a load balancer 
    +   Re-create an EC2 instance in case a previous one is terminated
-   ASG are free ( but as pay for the underlying EC2 )
Auto Scalling Group Attr
-   A Lunch Template 
    +   AMI  and Instance Type 
    +   EC2 User Data
    +   EBS volumes
    +   Security Groups
    +   SSH key pair 
    +   IAM roles for Your EC2 instances
    +   Network + Subnet Infor 
    +   Load Balancer infor 
-   Minsize / Maxsize / Intial Capacity
-   Scaling Policies
Auto Scalling - CloudWatch Alarams and Scalling 
-   It is possible to scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms 
-   An Alarm monitors a metric (such as Average CPU , or a custom metric)
-   Metrics such as Average CPU are computed for the overall ASG instances
-   Based on the alarm : 
    +   We can create scale-out policies (increase  number instance)
    +   We can create scale- policies (decrease  number instance)

ASG - Dynamic Scalling Policies
-   Target Tracking Scaling
-   Simple/Step Scalling 
    +   When a Cloudwatch alarm is trigger ( >  : add unit )
    +   When a Cloudwatch alarm is trigger ( <  : remove)
-   Scheduled Application  
    +   Anticipate a scaling based on known usage pattern 

ASG - Predictive Scalling 
    +   Predictive scalling : continuously forecast load and schedule scaling ahead

ASG - Good metrics 
    -   CPU Utilization : Average CPU utilization across your instances 
    -   RequestCountPerTarget : to make sure the number of requests per EC2 instances is stable 
    -   Average Network I/O 
    -   Any custom metric (using Cloudwatch)
ASG - Scalling Coldowns
-   After a scaling activity happens, you are in the 
    cooldown period (default 300s )
-   During the coldonw period, the ASG will not 
    launch or terminate additional instances
-   Advice : Use a ready-to-use API to reduce config time in 
    order to be serving req faster and reduce the cooldown period

ASG for SA
-   ASG default Termination Policy 
    1 : find the az which has the most number of instance
    2 : if there are multi instance in the az to choose from,
    delete the one with the oldest launch config
-   ASG tries the balance the number of instances across AZ by default 

ASG for SA - Lifecycle hook 
-   By default as soon as an instance is launched in an ASG it's in service
-   You have the ability to perform extra steps before instance goes in service
-   you have the ability to perform some actions before instance is terminated

ASG for SA - Launch Template vs Launch configurations
-   Both:
    +   ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) , the intsance type , a key pair 
    security groups and the other param(e.g : ec2 user-data) that you
    use to launch EC2 instance 
-   Launch Config (legacy)
    +   Must be re-created every time 
-   Launch Template (newer)
    +   Can have multiple versions
    +   Create pram subsets
    +   Provision using both On-Demand and Spot instances
    +   Can use T2 unlimited burst Feature
    +   Recommended by AWS going forward

Section 9 : 
AWS RDS Overview
-   RDS stands for Relational Database service
-   it's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language
-   It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
    +   Postgres
    +   MySQL
    +   MariaDB
    +   Oracle
    +   Microsoft SQL Server
    +   Aurora (not critial remember it )

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on ec2
-   RDS us a managed service:
    +   Automated provisioning , OS patching 
    +   Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp
    +   Monitoring dashboards 
    +   Read replicas for improved read performance
    +   Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
    +   Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
    +   Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
-   BUT you CAN't SSH into your instances

RDS backups
-   Backups are automatically enabled in RDS
-   Automated backups: 
    +   Daily full backup of the database 
    +   Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
    => ability to restore to any point in time (5 min)
    +   7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days )
-   DB Snapshots:
    +   Manually triggered by the user
    +   Retention of backup for as long as you want

RDS -  Storage Auto Scalling 
-   Helps you increase Storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
-   When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales auto
-   Avoid manually scaling your database storage
-   you have to set MAXIMUM STORAGE THRESHOLD 
-   Automatically modify storage if :
    +   Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
    +   Low-storage lasts at least 5 min
    +   6 hours have passed since last modification
-   Useful for appications with unpredictable workloads
-   Supports all RDS database engines

RDS Read Replicas for read scalability
-   Up to 5 Read Replicas
-   With in AZ, Cross Az or Cross Region
-   Replication is ASYNC so read are eventtually consistent
-   Replicas can be promoted to their own DB

RDS Read Replicas - Use Cases 
-   You have o production database that is taking on normal load
-   You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
-   You create a read replica to run the new workload there
-   The production application is unaffected
-   Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements
    (not INSERT, UPDATE , DELETE)

RDS - Network Cost

-   same AZ with other region : free (vd : us-east-1a <> us-east-1b)
-   other AZ same region : not free (vd : us-east-1a <> eu-west-1b)

RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)
-   SYNC Replication
-   One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby
-   Increase availability
-   Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
-   No manual intervention in apps
-   Not used for scaling
+   Note : The Read Replicas be setup as MULTI AZ for Disaster Recovery

RDS - FROM Single-AZ to multi AZ
-   Zero downtime operation
-   Just click on "modify" for the database config
-   The following happens internally
    +   A snapshot is taken
    +   A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ 
    +   Synchonization is established between the two databases 

RDS Security - Encryption
-   At rest encryption 
    +   Possibility to encrypt the master and replicas with AWS-AES 256
    +   Encryption has to be defined at lunch time
    +   If the master is not encrypted , the read replicas cannot be encrypted
    +   Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) available for Oracle and SQL Server
-   In Flight encryption
    +   SSL cert options with trust cert when connecting to database
    +   Provide SSL options with trust cert when connecting to database 
    +   To enforce SSL:
        *   PostgreSQL : _ssl = l in the AWS RDS Console
        *   My SQL : with in the DB  .... REQUIRE SSL
RDS Encryption operations 
-   Encrypting RDS Backups
    +   Snapshots of un-encrypted RDS databases are un-encrypted
    +   Snapshots of encrypted RDS databases are encrypted
    +   Can copy a snapshot into an encrypted one 
-   To encrypt an un-encrypted RDS database 
    +   Create a snapshot of the un-encrypted database
    +   Copy the snapshot and enable encryption for the snapshot
    +   Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot
    +   Migrate applications to the new database , and delete the old database

RDS Security - Network & IAM
-   Network Security
    +   RDS databases are usually deployed within a private subnet, not a public one
    +   RDS security work by leveraging security groups- it controls
    with IP/Security group can COMMUNICATE with RDS 
-   Access Management 
    +   IAM policies help control who can manage AWS RDS
    +   Traditional Username and Password can be used to login into the database 
    +   IAM-based authen can be used to login into RDS MySQL  & PostgreSQL

RDS - IAM authen
-   IAM database authen work with MYSQL AND POSTGRESQL
-   You don't need a password, just an authen token obtained thorugh IAM - RDS API
-   Auth token expired when after 15min
-   Benefits : 
    +   Network in/out must be encrypted using SSL
    +   IAM to centrally manage users instead of DB 
    +   Can Ieverage IAM Roles and EC2 Instance profiles for easy integration 

RDS Security - Summary 
-   Encryption at rest
    +   Is done only when you first create the DB instance
    +   or : unencrypted DB => snapshot => copy snapshot as encrypted
        => create DB from snapshot 
-   Your responsibility
    +   Check the ports / IP / Security group inbound rules in DB's SG
